#
## Motivation: 
### As an avid fan of all things scifi/fantasy and barstool trivia, I wanted to create an application that would challenge my knowledge in an entertaining environment. I chose the four movies I have seen the most to try and challenge others with some of the questions I found to be easy and quite difficult. 
#

## Rules:

* At the start screen you are offered 4 different catagories to choose from. 

* Once you have made your selection, the selected quiz will appear along with you scoreboard. 

* The scoreboard will keep track of how many questions you get right, wrong, and the amount of questions left on the quiz. 

* During play, if you get the answer correct the border of the question box will glow green but red if you are wrong. 

* You have 60 seconds to answer 10 questions. Your score will be tallied up at the end and displayed to you when you have completed the quiz.

## Pseudocode:

## Minimum Viable Product:
